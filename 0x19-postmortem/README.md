# Postmortem: CapitalizeMe Service Outage Incident

## Issue Summary
- **Duration:** April 15, 2023, 2:00 PM - April 16, 2023, 6:00 AM (PST)
- **Impact:** The CapitalizeMe service experienced a 16-hour downtime, resulting in the inability of users to capitalize paragraphs. All users were affected during this period.

## Timeline
- **April 15, 2023, 2:15 PM (PST):** The issue was detected when several users reported via customer support that the CapitalizeMe tool was not functioning correctly.
- **Actions Taken:** The engineering team immediately initiated an investigation, assuming that a recent code deployment might have caused the problem. They focused on analyzing the codebase and configuration changes.
- **Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:** The team spent considerable time reviewing recent code changes, searching for potential bugs or configuration errors, without identifying the root cause.
- **April 15, 2023, 4:30 PM (PST):** As the investigation progressed, it was escalated to the infrastructure team to investigate potential hardware or network issues.
- **April 15, 2023, 7:00 PM (PST):** The infrastructure team identified a misconfiguration in the load balancer that was causing the requests to the CapitalizeMe service to be dropped.
- **April 16, 2023, 6:00 AM (PST):** The incident was resolved, and the CapitalizeMe service was fully restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing requests to the CapitalizeMe service to be dropped. The load balancer was not properly forwarding incoming requests to the service, leading to the service unavailability.

To resolve the issue, the infrastructure team reconfigured the load balancer to ensure proper forwarding of requests to the CapitalizeMe service. Additionally, they conducted thorough testing to validate the fix before restoring the service.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- Improve Configuration Management: Implement stricter change control processes to ensure proper configuration checks are performed during deployments and routine maintenance.
- Enhanced Monitoring: Implement comprehensive monitoring for critical services, including load balancers, to proactively detect any misconfigurations or performance issues.
- Load Balancer Redundancy: Evaluate the load balancer setup for redundancy and implement failover mechanisms to prevent single points of failure.
- Incident Response Training: Conduct regular incident response training sessions to improve the team's ability to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Tasks to Address the Issue
1. Update Load Balancer Configuration: Modify the load balancer configuration to ensure proper forwarding of requests to the CapitalizeMe service. *(Deadline: May 1, 2023)*
2. Implement Change Control Process: Establish a formal change control process to review and validate configuration changes before deployment. *(Deadline: May 15, 2023)*
3. Implement Load Balancer Monitoring: Set up monitoring for load balancers to detect any misconfigurations or performance issues. *(Deadline: June 1, 2023)*
4. Load Balancer Redundancy Evaluation: Assess the load balancer setup and implement failover mechanisms for improved reliability. *(Deadline: June 30, 2023)*
5. Incident Response Training: Conduct regular incident response training sessions for the engineering and infrastructure teams. *(Ongoing)*

By implementing these measures and addressing the specific tasks outlined above, we aim to improve the overall reliability and resilience of the CapitalizeMe service, minimizing the chances of similar incidents in the future.
