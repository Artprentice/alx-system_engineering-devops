# Postmortem: CapitalizeMe Service Outage Incident

## Issue Summary
- **Duration:** April 15, 2023, 2:00 PM - April 16, 2023, 6:00 AM (PST)
- **Impact:** The CapitalizeMe service experienced a 16-hour downtime, leaving paragraphs uncapitalized and causing grammatical chaos. All users were affected during this period, resulting in a flood of poorly capitalized texts.

## Timeline
- **April 15, 2023, 2:15 PM (PST):** The issue was detected when users started complaining about their lack of capitalization prowess. We realized the situation was "sErIoUs" when the support team received an influx of messages resembling a lowercase rebellion.
- **Actions Taken:** The engineering team sprang into action, suspecting that a rogue code deployment had triggered the mayhem. We embarked on a quest to hunt down the elusive bug and restore the proper order of capitalization.

## Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths
- As self-proclaimed "captains of code," we initially blamed the recent interns for unleashing the lowercase chaos. We summoned them to a sacred meeting room and gave them stern looks, only to find out they were innocent. We called it the "Case of the Mistaken Interns."

## Root Cause and Resolution
After much debugging and a few pizza-fueled brainstorming sessions, we uncovered the true culprit: a mischievous gremlin had tampered with our load balancer configuration. The little troublemaker thought it would be funny to drop requests and leave paragraphs hanging in lowercase misery.

To restore order and banish the gremlin, we reconfigured the load balancer with utmost determination and triple-checked its settings. We also conducted a rigorous exorcism to ensure no other gremlins lingered in our system.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- We will establish a "Gremlin Detection and Extermination Squad" to conduct regular audits and ward off any mischievous beings.
- The interns will undergo rigorous "Capitalization Boot Camp" training sessions to enhance their code quality skills.
- Our load balancer configuration will be fortified with extra safeguards, including anti-gremlin enchantments and a "no lowercase allowed" policy.

## Tasks to Address the Issue
1. Update Load Balancer Configuration: Banish the gremlins by reconfiguring the load balancer to ensure proper forwarding of requests to the CapitalizeMe service. *(Deadline: May 1, 2023)*
2. Gremlin Detection and Extermination Squad Formation: Assemble a team of fearless bug hunters to keep our systems gremlin-free. *(Deadline: May 15, 2023)*
3. Capitalization Boot Camp: Train the interns in the sacred art of proper capitalization, empowering them to be guardians of grammatical integrity. *(Deadline: June 1, 2023)*
4. Load Balancer Safeguards: Strengthen the load balancer with additional security measures, including anti-gremlin enchantments and a "no lowercase allowed" policy. *(Deadline: June 30, 2023)*

By implementing these measures and embarking on a quest to eradicate gremlins and uphold proper capitalization, we shall restore peace and grammatical harmony to the CapitalizeMe service.

Remember, together we can conquer the lowercase rebellion and triumph over the forces of linguistic chaos!
